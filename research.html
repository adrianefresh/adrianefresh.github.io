                  Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act required covered jurisdictions—those deemed perniciously politically discriminatory to minorities—to preclear changes to their voting practices with the Department of Justice. By exploiting the use of a federally imposed threshold for how Section 5 coverage was applied in North Carolina, this article estimates the effect of coverage using a difference-in-differences design. This article finds that Section 5 coverage increased black voter registration by 14–19 percentage points, white registration by 10–13 percentage points, and overall voter turnout by 10–19 percentage points. Additional results for Democratic vote share suggest that some of this overall increase in turnout may have come from reactionary whites. This article finds that Section 5 coverage had a statistically and substantively meaningful effect on enfranchisement, although an effect consistent with the more modest of extant estimates in the literature.

                    Does economic modernization facilitate greater turnover in the political elite?  I empirically assess the extent to which the Industrial Revolution in Britain created greater diversity of political representation, against the null hypothesis that entrenched pre-industrial elites persisted in power.  To do so, I use an original dataset of Member of Parliament (MP) biographical information to measure political competition, the presence of political dynasties, and the circulation of new economic interests through political power.  Leveraging sub-national variation in industrialization over more than 150 years in both a differences-in-differences analysis and an instrumental variables analysis, I find that industrialization diversified the economic interests of MPs, increased electoral competition and reduced the presence of political dynasties.   Thus, new representatives were not simply the old elite in a new economic guise.  I interpret this as evidence in support of modernization theory --- economic modernization in the British Isles broke entrenched elites' direct hold on political power.

                      This paper considers the political consequences of the dramatic expansion of British overseas trade beginning in the late 16th century brought about by the discovery of new ocean shipping routes to Asia and the Americas.  Using an original individual-level dataset on the characteristics of Members of Parliament in England and Wales spanning two centuries (1550-1750), I examine the differential effect of an aggregate trend in expanding trade for constituencies more (as compared to less) directly connected to the expanding commercial economy.  I find some evidence that trade increased electoral contests and shifted representation towards the commercial elite, but little evidence that expanding trade fundamentally empowered new societal groups on other dimensions --- dynastic and aristocratic MPs, two markers of the traditional elite, were unaffected by the change.   Together these findings suggest conditions under which economic change produces a transformation in the political elite.

                          How is turnout affected by the decisions of election administrators to move Election Day polling places? We study the behavior of more than 2 million unique eligible voters across three presidential elections (2008-2016) in the swing state of North Carolina. We gather spatial information on the location of nearly every Election Day polling place location and we geolocate each voter relative to their polling place. Leveraging within-voter variation in polling place location change over time, we demonstrate that polling place changes reduce Election Day voting statewide on average, but that this effect is almost completely offset by substitution into early voting. This result obtains whether polling place changes increase or decrease travel costs, but Republican-led changes reduce overall turnout by producing less substitution relative to Democratic-led changes. We interpret our findings as highlighting the importance of early voting and voting primes for mitigating the non-travel costs of polling place changes.

                          The allocation of polling places and the assignment of voters into precincts in the US appear to be neutral, bureaucratic decisions. Despite this, accounts of elites manipulating access to the polls by race and partisanship have become increasingly common.  We systematically evaluate these accounts using a unique dataset of the universe of eligible voters, polling place locations and precinct boundaries across three presidential elections in the closely contested state of North Carolina.  We find that while a small subset of counties allocate polling places consistent with partisan manipulation, on the whole, such manipulation is far less prevalent than anecdotal evidence would suggest.  Furthermore, we find little evidence that the Shelby County v. Holder Supreme Court decision, which removed minority voter protections in some North Carolina counties, had a fundamental impact on polling place allocation.  Our results indicate the importance of examining statewide effects when thinking about the consequences of these administrative decisions for elections, and also suggest the need for greater theoretical and empirical attention to understanding local variation in partisan manipulation of election administration.

                      How  do  democratically-elected  politicians  survive  being  removed  from  power  by  an  author-itarian  regime?  We  investigate  the  determinants  of  political  survival  across  Chile’s  militarydictatorship  (1973-1990),  which  disbanded  the  national  legislature  and  disrupted  sources  ofpolitical  dominance.  We  collect  individual-level  biographical  data  on  the  universe  of  deputiesand  senators  in  Chile’s  National  Congress  and  archival  data  on  the  experiences  of  those  politi-cians  under  the  Pinochet  regime  —  including  whether  pre-1973  politicians  were  incorporatedinto  the  Pinochet  government,  sent  into  exile  abroad,  or  employed  in  the  domestic  privatesector.  Amongst  politicians  on  the  ideological  left,  we  show  that  exiled  politicians  were  just  aselectorally  successful  as  those  leftist  politicians  who  remained  in  the  domestic  private  sector.Moreover,  while  we  find  evidence  that  politicians  who  found  positions  within  the  Pinochetregime  were  more  likely  to  win  elections  after  democratization  than  their  counterparts  on  theright  who  did  not,  but  this  relationship  is  a  consequence  of  which  politicians  were  selected  bythe  regime.  Although  political  dynasties  are  an  important  feature  of  Chilean  politics,  we  donot  document  an  important  role  of  this  familial  power  in  moderating  the  effect  of  trajectoriesor  providing  an  alternative  method  of  survival.

                We study how local elites in the US South responded to the enfranchisement of blacks after the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA) removed their ability to use Jim Crow policies to limit minority political participation.  In particular, we (aim to) evaluate the extent to which white elites responded to black enfranchisement with the increased and racially-targeted use of local institutions of the carceral state --- police, the courts and the prison system.

                To test whether carceral institutions became a de facto "New Jim Crow" we collect new and unique panel data on prison intake by-county by-race for the 11 states of the former Confederacy from approximately 1940-1990.  We (aim to) use this data in a difference-in-differences research design to isolate the effect of the VRA on black criminal sentences, sentence length, and incarceration rates.  Along with temporal variation from before to after the adoption of the VRA in 1965, our research design exploits two forms of geographic variation in the impact of the VRA across counties and states. First, we leverage the fact that not all counties in the former Confederacy were subject to the key provisions of the VRA, including federal monitoring of voter registration and Section 5 pre-clearance of changes to voting related practices.  And second, following existing work, we assess how the impact of the VRA varied by states' pre-VRA legal regimes. We (plan to) test whether states with pre-VRA Jim Crow laws (e.g. literacy tests and poll taxes) saw larger changes in black carceral outcomes following imposition of the VRA than those without such laws.

                We also (plan to) test a prominent alternative explanation in the literature for how black incarceration rates responded to black enfranchisement: that increased black incarceration was a product of blacks --- particularly middle-class blacks --- using their new-found political power in the wake of the Civil Rights movement to police their own communities because white elites had not previously had the incentive to do so.  As one test of this "Self-policing" argument, we (plan to) evaluate whether the effect of the VRA on county-level black incarceration rates varies by the race of local elected officials, data on which we request funding to continue to collect. If the increase in black incarceration rates is driven by efforts by the black electorate and their representatives to control rising crime in their own communities, we would expect increased minority incarceration when blacks obtain local office.

                Our project seeks to make a contribution to literatures on minority politics, the effectiveness of civil rights legislation, and the sources of contemporary mass incarceration by providing the first systematic empirical test of two prominent arguments linking political representation to the use of the carceral state.
