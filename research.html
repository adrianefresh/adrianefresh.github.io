                  Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act required covered jurisdictions—those deemed perniciously politically discriminatory to minorities—to preclear changes to their voting practices with the Department of Justice. By exploiting the use of a federally imposed threshold for how Section 5 coverage was applied in North Carolina, this article estimates the effect of coverage using a difference-in-differences design. This article finds that Section 5 coverage increased black voter registration by 14–19 percentage points, white registration by 10–13 percentage points, and overall voter turnout by 10–19 percentage points. Additional results for Democratic vote share suggest that some of this overall increase in turnout may have come from reactionary whites. This article finds that Section 5 coverage had a statistically and substantively meaningful effect on enfranchisement, although an effect consistent with the more modest of extant estimates in the literature.

                    Does economic modernization facilitate greater turnover in the political elite?  I empirically assess the extent to which the Industrial Revolution in Britain created greater diversity of political representation, against the null hypothesis that entrenched pre-industrial elites persisted in power.  To do so, I use an original dataset of Member of Parliament (MP) biographical information to measure political competition, the presence of political dynasties, and the circulation of new economic interests through political power.  Leveraging sub-national variation in industrialization over more than 150 years in both a differences-in-differences analysis and an instrumental variables analysis, I find that industrialization diversified the economic interests of MPs, increased electoral competition and reduced the presence of political dynasties.   Thus, new representatives were not simply the old elite in a new economic guise.  I interpret this as evidence in support of modernization theory --- economic modernization in the British Isles broke entrenched elites' direct hold on political power.

                      This paper considers the political consequences of the dramatic expansion of British overseas trade beginning in the late 16th century brought about by the discovery of new ocean shipping routes to Asia and the Americas.  Using an original individual-level dataset on the characteristics of Members of Parliament in England and Wales spanning two centuries (1550-1750), I examine the differential effect of an aggregate trend in expanding trade for constituencies more (as compared to less) directly connected to the expanding commercial economy.  I find some evidence that trade increased electoral contests and shifted representation towards the commercial elite, but little evidence that expanding trade fundamentally empowered new societal groups on other dimensions --- dynastic and aristocratic MPs, two markers of the traditional elite, were unaffected by the change.   Together these findings suggest conditions under which economic change produces a transformation in the political elite.

                          How do changes in Election Day polling place locations affect voter turnout? We study the behavior of more than 2 million eligible voters across three closely-contested presidential elections (2008-2016) in the swing state of North Carolina. Leveraging within-voter variation in polling place location change over time, we demonstrate that polling place changes reduce Election Day voting on average statewide. However, this effect is almost completely offset by substitution into early voting, suggesting that voters, on average, respond to a change in their polling place by choosing to vote early. While there is heterogeneity in these effects by the distance of the polling place change and the race of the affected voter, the fully offsetting substitution into early voting still obtains.  We theorize this is because voters whose polling places change location receive notification mailers, offsetting search costs and priming them to think about the election before election day, driving early voting.

                          Do local election administrators change precincts and polling place locations to target voters based on their partisanship or race? We systematically evaluate whether decisions consistent with targeting occur using the near universe of eligible voters, polling place locations, and precinct boundaries across three presidential elections in the closely contested state of North Carolina.  Overall, we find no evidence that local administrators allocate precincts and polling places in a manner consistent with partisan manipulation for electoral gain.  Some counties appear to differentially target opposition party voters with these changes, but closer examination reveals that the county-level variation we document is likely due to random variation, not deliberate manipulation.  There is also little evidence that the removal of minority voter protections in Shelby County v. Holder impacted polling place placement.  If partisan-motivated decisions occur, they are seemingly more idiosyncratic than pervasive.

                      How  do  democratically-elected  politicians  survive  being  removed  from  power  by  an  authoritarian  regime?  We  investigate  the  determinants  of  political  survival  across  Chile’s  military dictatorship  (1973-1990),  which  disbanded  the  national  legislature  and  disrupted  sources  of political  dominance.  We  collect  individual-level  biographical  data  on  the  universe  of  deputies and  senators  in  Chile’s  National  Congress  and  archival  data  on  the  experiences  of  those  politicians  under  the  Pinochet  regime  —--  including  whether  pre-1973  politicians  were  incorporated into  the  Pinochet  government,  sent  into  exile  abroad,  or  employed  in  the  domestic  private sector.  Among  politicians  on  the  ideological  left,  we  show  that  exiled  politicians  were  just  as electorally  successful  as  those  leftist  politicians  who  remained  in  the  domestic  private  sector.  Moreover,  while  we  find  evidence  that  politicians  who  found  positions  within  the  Pinochetregime  were  more  likely  to  win  elections  after  democratization  than  their  counterparts  on  the right  who  did  not,  this  relationship  is  a  consequence  of  which  politicians  were  selected  by the  regime.  Although  political  dynasties  are  an  important  feature  of  Chilean  politics,  we  do not  document  an  important  role  of  this  familial  power  in  moderating  the  effect  of  trajectories or  providing  an  alternative  method  of  political survival.

                        Prominent scholars have viewed the Great Reform Act as a concession made by incumbent elites in order to defuse a revolutionary threat from below.  In this paper, we argue that the threat from below did not entail a significant risk of regime overthrow and was addressed by establishing professional police forces in all provincial towns and approximately half of counties.  These forces had been stoutly opposed by the gentry since the Glorious Revolution on the grounds that they would increase Crown power too much.  Thus, to make professional police forces politically viable required first reforming the budgetary and electoral systems at all levels of governance --- national, municipal and county --- so as to ensure taxpayers that their representatives, not the Crown, would control the finances of the new forces.  We support this argument of how representation and state-making shaped the Great Reform Act with substantial qualitative historical evidence, and consistent quantitative evidence --- both from an analysis of Swing Riots and votes on the Civil List reform bill, and a difference-in-differences analysis of how Swing Riots predict the establishment and spending on municipal police forces.

                We study how local elites in the US South responded to the enfranchisement of blacks after the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA) removed their ability to use Jim Crow policies to limit minority political participation.  In particular, we (aim to) evaluate the extent to which white elites responded to black enfranchisement with the increased and racially-targeted use of local institutions of the carceral state --- police, the courts and the prison system.

                To test whether carceral institutions became a de facto "New Jim Crow" we collect new and unique panel data on prison intake by-county by-race for the 11 states of the former Confederacy from approximately 1940-1990.  We (aim to) use this data in a difference-in-differences research design to isolate the effect of the VRA on black criminal sentences, sentence length, and incarceration rates.  Along with temporal variation from before to after the adoption of the VRA in 1965, our research design exploits two forms of geographic variation in the impact of the VRA across counties and states. First, we leverage the fact that not all counties in the former Confederacy were subject to the key provisions of the VRA, including federal monitoring of voter registration and Section 5 pre-clearance of changes to voting related practices.  And second, following existing work, we assess how the impact of the VRA varied by states' pre-VRA legal regimes. We (plan to) test whether states with pre-VRA Jim Crow laws (e.g. literacy tests and poll taxes) saw larger changes in black carceral outcomes following imposition of the VRA than those without such laws.

                We also (plan to) test a prominent alternative explanation in the literature for how black incarceration rates responded to black enfranchisement: that increased black incarceration was a product of blacks --- particularly middle-class blacks --- using their new-found political power in the wake of the Civil Rights movement to police their own communities because white elites had not previously had the incentive to do so.  As one test of this "Self-policing" argument, we (plan to) evaluate whether the effect of the VRA on county-level black incarceration rates varies by the race of local elected officials, data on which we request funding to continue to collect. If the increase in black incarceration rates is driven by efforts by the black electorate and their representatives to control rising crime in their own communities, we would expect increased minority incarceration when blacks obtain local office.

                Our project seeks to make a contribution to literatures on minority politics, the effectiveness of civil rights legislation, and the sources of contemporary mass incarceration by providing the first systematic empirical test of two prominent arguments linking political representation to the use of the carceral state.

                    Political dynasties have generally been seen as puzzle in democratic contexts, antithetical to democratic ideals about the broad opportunity structure of political power.  While existing theories note an important institutional component in perpetuating this type of establishment politician, less work has examined the puzzle of democratic dynasties from the perspective of voters.  I employ a conjoint survey experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey of US adults to evaluate the causal effect of dynastic political ties independent of other important candidate attributes.  I show that respondents are largely unresponsive to the dynastic status of candidates, despite strong preferences for candidates with more political experience of other types.  This unresponsiveness occurs despite dynastic candidates being perceived as less competent, yet also less susceptible to outside political influence.  My findings suggest that while voters do make inferences about various features of candidate competency and integrity based on dynastic status, those inferences are not sufficient in the contemporary US landscape to affect vote choice, though they may in less polarized contexts.

                    Do natural resources affect the ability of local elites to entrench themselves in power?  We study the boom and bust cycle of the nitrate industry in northern Chile during the first part of the 20th century.  During that period, Chile had the only commercially viable sources of sodium nitrate; a valuable commodity used as both a fertilizer and explosive.  Nitrate exports accounted for two third of Chile's total exports and half of government revenues during the period, but the development of a synthetic alternative in the 1920s led to a collapse of the industry.  Using new panel data on mayors, parliamentary representatives, vote shares, and  nitrate extraction, we evaluate the extent of differential individual and familial (dynastic) incumbency advantage in nitrate-rich as compared to non-nitrate rich areas over the boom and bust cycle of the industry.  By exploiting the exogenous bust of the industry, we're able to evaluate whether patterns of elite entrenchment are related to the presence of the highly valuable resource, or other local time-varying factors.  Our preliminary results document lower levels of individual and familial incumbency in nitrate-rich areas during the boom years --- results that run counter to standard resource-curse theory.  We also find no differential change in elite concentration when the nitrate industry busted.  Our ongoing work is investigating potential causes of these findings in an effort to inform theory that can be tested out-of-sample.

                        Research questions are typically evaluated, in part, on the subjective dimension of whether they are ``worth answering.''  In this article, I contend that the vague and ad-hoc criteria currently employed in this subjective evaluative exercise have serious implications for what research questions are asked, and what scientific knowledge about the world can in turn be generated.  In addressing this problem, I propose a Bayesian model of knowledge generation in a setting where knowledge is defined by the relationship between two variables.  The model allows for two distinct ways in which we learn about the relationship between those two variables --- (1) the magnitude of that relationship (i.e. posterior/prior), and (2) the confidence we have in the magnitude of that relationship (i.e. the variance of the posterior/prior).  I make a normative argument for why each of these two ways of learning about the world are important, and I demonstrate what knowledge becomes unknowable when we ask research questions that we expect to teach us about (1) or (2) alone.  I then propose a set of evaluative criteria that, while still fundamentally subjective, make the tradeoffs involved in asking or not asking a particular question clear.  Finally, I discuss the institutions involved in structuring incentives for asking some types of research questions versus others, and offer specific suggestions for shifting incentives in the interest of expanding the knowledge that the sciences can potentially generate.
