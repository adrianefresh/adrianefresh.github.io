excerpt: "This paper examines how population growth and urbanization---core processes of modernization---shaped subnational political development in 19th-century Britain. Using new data on the universe of Members of Parliament, I show that constituencies with larger and denser populations followed sharply different political trajectories, experiencing greater electoral contestation and the declining presence of traditional elites. Democratic reform amplified divergent constituency trajectories; particularly by reallocating geographic political power toward growing urban areas, rather than expanding the electorate. By comparing estimation approaches that capture both <i>(i)</i> historical divergence and <i>(ii)</i> marginal causal effects, the paper shows that population is strongly associated with political development in the aggregate, yet has limited causal leverage at the margin. The population revolution mattered for Britain's political modernization, not because it reshaped local politics through incremental population change, but instead via cumulative, long-run processes that jointly produced both dense, urban populations and a new political class."
