I am Assistant Research Professor in the [Interdisciplinary Data Science Program](https://datascience.duke.edu/) and the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.duke.edu/) at Duke University.  

From 2019-2025, I was Assistant Professor (Tenure Track) in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.duke.edu/) at Duke.  I chose to leave the tenure track to cultivate more work-life balance, while still pursuing the academic work that I love. I'm happy to discuss the choice if you'd like to know more.   

Before coming to Duke, I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the [Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/) at Vanderbilt University.  I received my PhD in [Political Science](https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/) from Stanford University in 2017.  I also hold an MA in [Economics](https://economics.stanford.edu/) from Stanford University, and BAs in both Economics and Latin American Studies, where I also minored in Mathematics, from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). After completing my undergraduate degrees, I spent three years as a Research Assistant at the [Brookings Institute](https://www.brookings.edu/) in Washington, DC where I worked on topics in financial, transportation, and telecommunications regulation.  

I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington.
