I am Assistant Research Professor in the [Interdisciplinary Data Science Program](https://datascience.duke.edu/) and the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.duke.edu/) at Duke University.  

I study political economy and institutions in Comparative and American Politics. My work explores how elites adapt to transformative economic and institutional change, and how these shifts shape elite survival and power. I draw on cases ranging from the Industrial Revolution in Britain to Black enfranchisement and contemporary election administration in the United States. My research emphasizes quantitative methods, especially causal inference and large-scale text analysis.

From 2019-2025, I was Assistant Professor (Tenure Track) in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.duke.edu/) at Duke.  I chose to leave the tenure track to cultivate more work-life balance, while still pursuing the academic work that I love. I'm happy to discuss the choice if you'd like to know more.   

Before coming to Duke, I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the [Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/) at Vanderbilt University.  I received my PhD in [Political Science](https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/) from Stanford University in 2017.  I also hold an MA in [Economics](https://economics.stanford.edu/) from Stanford University, and BAs in both Economics and Latin American Studies and a minor in Mathematics from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). After completing my undergraduate degrees, I spent three years as a Research Assistant at the [Brookings Institute](https://www.brookings.edu/) in Washington, DC where I worked on topics in financial, transportation, and telecommunications regulation.  

I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington.
